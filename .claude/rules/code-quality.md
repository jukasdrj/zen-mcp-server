# Code Quality Checks

Before making any changes or submitting PRs, always run the comprehensive quality checks:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment first
source venv/bin/activate

# Run all quality checks (linting, formatting, tests)
./code_quality_checks.sh
```

This script automatically runs:
- Ruff linting with auto-fix
- Black code formatting
- Import sorting with isort
- Complete unit test suite (excluding integration tests)
- Verification that all checks pass 100%

## Linting Issues

```bash
# Auto-fix most linting issues
ruff check . --fix
black .
isort .

# Check what would be changed without applying
ruff check .
black --check .
isort --check-only .
```
