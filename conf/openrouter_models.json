It\u2019s post-trained for agentic workflows (RAG, tool calling) via SFT across math, code, science, and multi-turn chat, followed by multiple RL stages; Reward-aware Preference Optimization (RPO) for alignment, RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for step-wise reasoning, and iterative DPO to refine tool-use behavior. A distillation-driven Neural Architecture Search (\u201cPuzzle\u201d) replaces some attention blocks and varies FFN widths to shrink memory footprint and improve throughput, enabling single-GPU (H100/H200) deployment while preserving instruction following and CoT quality.\n\nIn internal evaluations (NeMo-Skills, up to 16 runs, temp = 0.6, top_p = 0.95), the model reports strong reasoning/coding results, e.g., MATH500 pass@1 = 97.4, AIME-2024 = 87.5, AIME-2025 = 82.71, GPQA = 71.97, LiveCodeBench (24.10\u201325.02) = 73.58, and MMLU-Pro (CoT) = 79.53. The model targets practical inference efficiency (high tokens/s, reduced VRAM) with Transformers/vLLM support and explicit \u201creasoning on/off\u201d modes (chat-first defaults, greedy recommended when disabled). Suitable for building agents, assistants, and long-context retrieval systems where balanced accuracy-to-cost and reliable tool use matter.\n",

      "description": "Grok 3 Mini is a lightweight, smaller thinking model. Unlike traditional models that generate answers immediately, Grok 3 Mini thinks before responding. It\u2019s ideal for reasoning-heavy tasks that don\u2019t demand extensive domain knowledge, and shines in math-specific and quantitative use cases, such as solving challenging puzzles or math problems.\n\nTransparent \"thinking\" traces accessible. Defaults to low reasoning, can boost with setting `reasoning: { effort: \"high\" }`\n\nNote: That there are two xAI endpoints for this model. By default when using this model we will always route you to the base endpoint. If you want the fast endpoint you can add `provider: { sort: throughput}`, to sort by throughput instead. \n",
